#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


/*
int *p  = NULL; //valid
int &j ; //invalid; reference cannot be NULL

//both refers to address!

pointers can point to different variables at different times
for a reference its referent is fixed

unlike reference pointer requires null checking


pointer allows user to operate on address
inc, diff pointers etc




use of poieres helps to aplly operator on addr by treating it as value
reference does not. */
